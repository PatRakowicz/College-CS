# Write Python code that outputs the lyrics to "99 Bottles of beer"
# verses:
# x bottles of beer on the wall | X bottles of beer (take one down, pass it around)
# X-1 bottles of beer on the wall
# Bottle of beer / Bottles of beer
# Ends - no more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer
# - go to the store, by some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall
