#12)	Create another table called duplicateOrders. Populate it with some of the same information from the  original orders table, and add some other different info of your own creation.
	#a)	Write a query that shows what information is duplicated between the two tables. You'll have to use a subquery with something like: 
		#select â€¦ where (orderId, customerId, orderDate) in (subquery here)
select distinct *
from orders
where (orderId, customerId, orderDate) in (
	select distinct *
    from duplicateOrders
);

	#b)	Now write a version of the query that tells you how many duplicate orders you have.
select *, count(*)
from orders
where (orderId, customerId, orderDate) in (
	select *
    from duplicateOrders
    group by orderId, customerId, orderDate
    having count(orderId)
    and count(customerId)
    and count(orderDate)
);
