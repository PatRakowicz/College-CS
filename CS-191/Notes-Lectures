CS 191 Lecture / Notes

Variables and IDEs

Variable
	Recall that variables are a name given to a location in memory that stores a value
	C++ Has a stronger tying that a language like Python
	
Initialization
	A variable is initialized to a value the first time that is assigned a value

A way to do this

#include <iostream>
int main () {
	int x; // Declaration
	x = 5; // Initialization

	int y = 3; // Declaration and initalization in a single line
}

int
	Allocates 4 bytes in memory
float
	float: no fixed umber of diguts before/after decimal
	double: double percision floating point number
bool
	can take on a Ture/False value (1 Byte of memory)
char
	characters store a single sring character
	Must using single quotes around the character
string
	Must be used with Double quotes


Casting

In C++ we can also preform casting to explicity defile the type we need

Inplicit Casting
	Are done when c++ takes care of casting for you, this is not always possibe

Explicit Casting
	occurs when you explicitly tall C++ what you want the variable to data cast as
	How do i cast type X as Y in C++?


Operations

Addition
	addition is a binary operation that adds the two values together to produce a single output
	works on doubles, ints, numeric types, etc.

Division
	If i devide two integers, what do i get back?


<cmath> Library
	If needed additional math


Writing SudoCode Lecture

n = length(s)
FUNCTION palidrome(s):
	for i=0 to [length(s)/2];
		if s[i] != s[length(s)-i-1];
			return false;
	return true;

Runtime: T(n) == n
	T(n) = O(n)

Ex: 2
check the longest prefix of two string
hello
helloworld

n = min(length(s1), length(s2))
T(n) = O(n)

function prefix(s1, s2)
	pref = ""
	for i=0 to [min(length(s1), lengths(s2))-1]
		if s1[i] == s2[i]
			pref += s1[i]
		else
			break
	return pref
